# Instructions

## Libre office way

This year 2023 you can submit the assignments as a printout form.
Now, this may change, at any given time. 

Now you will find a [`docs`](https://github.com/0thorderlogic/cs/tree/master/DAA/docs) folder with files named 01.odt, 02.odt, ...... 0N.odt also another file called [daa_assignment.ott](https://github.com/0thorderlogic/cs/blob/master/DAA/docs/daa_assignment.ott) an OTT file is a document template. This is the template I followed and you could too.

I am using [Libre office](https://www.libreoffice.org/) on [fedora linux](https://getfedora.org/) because I am cool like that. You could install libre office on windows too if you want.

After you have Libre office and the necessary files (01.odt, 02.odt, ...... 0N.odt) from the [`docs`](https://github.com/0thorderlogic/cs/tree/master/DAA/docs) folder open these up in [Libre office writer](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/writer/) do this:

```
STEP 1: OPEN FILE using LIBRE OFFICE WRITER
STEP 2: Change font for both text and code.
STEP 3: PRESS `alt+f` or the `File` button on the top left
STEP 4: In the drop-down menu, navigate below to Export as 
STEP 5: Click Export directly as PDF
```

You are done!

## Online

Alternatively, you can visit [this here website](https://online2pdf.com/convert-odt-to-pdf) and upload all files as you need and get a merged pdf!

## Last resort

> Only for batches after 2021-2022

There is a good chance you will get the same questions we got this year 10 years down the line, you could find a file called the [master.odt](#) or [master.pdf](#) when I do get around to it middle of 2023.
